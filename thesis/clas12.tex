\chapter{The CLAS12 Drift Chamber}

\section{Overview}

The CLAS12 Drift Chamber (DC) is a subsystem of the CLAS12 particle
detector, located inside one of the halls of the Thomas
Jefferson National Facility, Newport News Virginia, U.S.A. The
detector is used at the core of many experiments, designed to gather
information on particle interactions, mostly originating from an
electron beam hitting a target inside of its center.

After interacting with the target, the resulting particles pass
through the drift chamber subsystem that is designed to measure their
momentum, which is done to aquire further insights into the underlying
physical processes. This core responsibility of the drift chamber to
register the results of particle interaction is the reason, why it is
deemed to be the most crucial subsystem of the CLAS12 particle
detector.
