  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Convolutional Neural Networks work well for fault detection
    \item Blurred fault problem will be solved in the future
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Will use real world blurred faults during training
        \item After all, a deep learning system can only be as good as
          the data it was trained on
      \end{itemize}
    \item Next step: fault localization
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Need to know, where exactly a fault is located
        \item State-of-the-art: YOLOv3, a CNN specialized in
          object localization
        \item Use the present system as a pre-stage classifier
      \end{itemize}
    \item Excited to see, how the system will perform on the hundreds
      of petabytes of real CLAS12 drift chamber data
  \end{itemize}
